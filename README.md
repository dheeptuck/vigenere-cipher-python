This is a sample program to emulate vigenere cipher encryption and decryption. 
This program consists of four steps:

1. Convert the string(plain text and key) to an equivalent number list for computation.
2. Encrypt the number list.
3. Decrypt the cipher list.
4. Convert the deciphered list to string.(i.e 0->a, 1->b and so on)

Note: This only works for strings with lower case alphabets.
